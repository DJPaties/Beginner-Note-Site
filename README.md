# Beginner-Note-Site
This Django project was done for first time practicing. Any tips and suggestions are welcomed!
Excuse any messy code as this project was done after finishing the django docs.
My discord is found  in the bio incase for sharing any stuff that would help like suggestions or tips.
This project aim was to create note, view all the notes available, view each detail of the note, and deleting a note according to the id that resembles it.
Time invested for front-end was not a priority as much as the back-end had the priority although it was a small project.
Thank you for the time spent! 
Always willing to become better with more practice?
